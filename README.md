To have these files work, you need to use the BeautifulSoup API for Python (which is used for webscraping), the Cytoscape.JS API (which is used to render the DAG), and the cytoscape-dagre layout for Cytoscape.js (which is used to layout the nodes in a coherent way), and jQuery (we're using google's CDN).
jQuery is already included in the index.html file.
