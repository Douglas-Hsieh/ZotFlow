To have these files work, you need to used the BeautifulSoup API for Python (which is used for webscraping), the Cytoscape.JS API (which is used to render the DAG), the cytoscape-dagre layout for Cytoscape.js (which is used to layout the nodes in a coherent way).

This is the link for the cytoscape API.
The API is pretty extensively documented.

Use pip to install this.

This is the layout that you have to download
Download Node.js (it takes less than 10 minutes to download) and use the npm to install this.
